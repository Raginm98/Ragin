Architecture Overview:
Data Ingestion:

Azure Event Hubs:
Use Azure Event Hubs for ingesting real-time data streams such as ad impressions (JSON) and bid requests (Avro).
Set up separate Event Hubs for each data source.
Azure Blob Storage:
For batch ingestion of click/conversion data (CSV), use Azure Blob Storage with Azure Data Factory or Azure Logic Apps for scheduled batch processing.
Data Processing:

Azure Databricks:
Implement data transformation processes using Azure Databricks to standardize and enrich the data.
Leverage Databricks notebooks for writing ETL jobs.
Handle data validation, filtering, and deduplication in Databricks.
Correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions within Databricks using common identifiers (e.g., user ID, ad creative ID).
Data Storage and Query Performance:

Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse):
Store processed data in Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient analytical querying.
Optimize tables and indexes to enhance query performance.
Use dedicated SQL pool to allocate resources based on workload requirements.
Error Handling and Monitoring:

Azure Monitor:
Utilize Azure Monitor to set up alerts for detecting anomalies, discrepancies, or delays.
Create custom log queries to identify and analyze issues.
Azure Logic Apps:
Implement Logic Apps for automated alerting and notification based on predefined thresholds.
Set up Logic Apps to trigger remediation workflows in case of data quality issues.
Integrate with Azure DevOps for continuous monitoring and improvement.
Workflow:
Data Ingestion Workflow:

Real-time ingestion from various sources using Azure Event Hubs.
Scheduled batch processing for CSV data using Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Factory/Logic Apps.
Data Processing Workflow:

Transformation, validation, filtering, and deduplication in Azure Databricks.
Correlation of ad impressions with clicks and conversions.
Data Storage Workflow:

Store processed data in Azure Synapse Analytics for analytical queries.
Error Handling and Monitoring Workflow:

Use Azure Monitor for continuous monitoring.
Set up alerts in Azure Monitor to trigger Logic Apps for remediation.
Integrate with Azure DevOps for continuous improvement.
Considerations:
Azure services provide scalability and can handle high data volumes efficiently.
Azure Synapse Analytics is suitable for storing large volumes of analytical data.
Azure Databricks supports scalable and collaborative Apache Spark-based analytics.
Implementing thorough testing and logging mechanisms is crucial for maintaining data quality.
This architecture provides a scalable, efficient, and monitored solution for AdvertiseX's data engineering requirements in the digital advertising space using Azure services. Adjustments may be needed based on specific workload characteristics and data volumes.
